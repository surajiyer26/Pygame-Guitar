All you need to run this project is -
<br>(1) Make sure Python is installed in your device
<br>(2) Make sure Pygame is installed in your device (you can simply do a 'pip install pygame')
<br>(3) Make sure all the files provided here are in the same directory
<br>(4) Open your terminal, cd to the directory with the files, and run myguitar.py

The convention of the strings is as follows -
<br>e(low) - played using '1' or 'A'
<br>a - played using '2' or 'S'
<br>d - played using '3' or 'D'
<br>g - played using '4' or 'F'
<br>b - played using '5' or 'G'
<br>e(high) - played using '6' or 'H'

The strings are basically playable using keyboard keys from 1 to 6, or from characters 'A' to 'H', you could also simply left click on the strings using your mouse.

I made this small project on my very first day of learning Pygame. Implemented it just by learning how to paste and move images, and how to play sounds, and with a little bit of programming experience.
